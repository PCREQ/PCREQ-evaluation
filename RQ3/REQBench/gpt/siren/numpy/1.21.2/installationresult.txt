The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested six==1.12.0
    absl-py 0.9.0 depends on six
    astroid 2.3.1 depends on six==1.12
    bleach 6.0.0 depends on six>=1.9.0
    blessings 1.7 depends on six
    cycler 0.10.0 depends on six
    docker-pycreds 0.4.0 depends on six>=1.4.0
    fastparquet 0.3.2 depends on six
    google-auth 1.10.0 depends on six>=1.9.0
    google-pasta 0.2.0 depends on six

    visdom 0.1.8.9 depends on six
    wandb 0.12.5 depends on six>=1.13.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
