ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/LLM/result/chatgpt/hifi-gan-numpy-1.21.2.txt (line 15) and llvmlite==0.37.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested llvmlite==0.37.0
    numba 0.55.2 depends on llvmlite<0.39 and >=0.38.0rc1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
