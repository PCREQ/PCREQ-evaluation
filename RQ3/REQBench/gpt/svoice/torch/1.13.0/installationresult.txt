The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==1.13.0
    torchaudio 0.13.0 depends on torch==1.13.0
    torchvision 0.13.0 depends on torch==1.12.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
