The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==1.8.1
    torchaudio 0.8.1 depends on torch==1.8.1
    torchvision 0.8.2 depends on torch==1.7.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
