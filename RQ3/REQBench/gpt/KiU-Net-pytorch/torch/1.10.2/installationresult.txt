ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/LLM/result/chatgpt/KiU-Net-pytorch-torch-1.10.2.txt (line 21) and torch==1.10.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==1.10.2
    torchvision 0.11.1 depends on torch==1.10.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#fixing-conflicting-dependencies
