ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/LLM/result/chatgpt/PyTorch-ENet-torch-1.13.0.txt (line 15) and torch==1.13.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==1.13.0
    torchvision 0.13.1 depends on torch==1.12.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
