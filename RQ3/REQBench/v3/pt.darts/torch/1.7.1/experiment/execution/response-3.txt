Based on the error and analysis, the issue stems from an API change in torchvision's CIFAR10 dataset interface. The error occurs when trying to access `train_data` which was renamed in later versions. Since we must maintain torch==1.7.1, we need to adjust torchvision to a compatible version that maintains the older API.
