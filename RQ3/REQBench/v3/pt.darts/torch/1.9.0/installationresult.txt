ERROR: Invalid requirement: "Based on the error and analysis, the issue stems from an API change in torchvision's CIFAR10 dataset interface between versions. The error indicates that `train_data` attribute is no longer available in the version being used. Since we must maintain torch==1.9.0, we need to adjust torchvision to a compatible version that maintains the expected API while working with torch 1.9.0."
