Based on the error and analysis, the issue appears to be with PyTorch installation rather than OpenCV. The error shows torch isn't found, suggesting it's not properly installed in the environment. Here's the adjusted requirements.txt with compatible versions for Python 3.7 while maintaining opencv-python==4.8.0.74:
coloredlogs==15.0.1
humanfriendly==10.0
