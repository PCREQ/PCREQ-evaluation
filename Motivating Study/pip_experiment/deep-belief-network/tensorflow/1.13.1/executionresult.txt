WARNING:tensorflow:From /dataset/lei/anaconda3/envs/deep-belief-network-tensorflow-1.13.1/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py:263: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/tensorflow/1.5/deep-belief-network/dbn/tensorflow/models.py:150: to_float (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/tensorflow/1.5/deep-belief-network/dbn/tensorflow/models.py:338: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
