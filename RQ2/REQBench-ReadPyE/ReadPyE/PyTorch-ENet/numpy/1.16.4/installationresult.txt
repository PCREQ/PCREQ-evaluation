ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/PyTorch-ENet-numpy-1.16.4.txt (line 1) and numpy==1.16.4 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.16.4
    matplotlib 3.5.3 depends on numpy>=1.17

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
