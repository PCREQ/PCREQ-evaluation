ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/siamese-pytorch-numpy-1.16.2.txt (line 2), -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/siamese-pytorch-numpy-1.16.2.txt (line 3) and numpy==1.16.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.16.2
    scipy 1.5.4 depends on numpy>=1.14.5
    matplotlib 3.5.3 depends on numpy>=1.17

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
