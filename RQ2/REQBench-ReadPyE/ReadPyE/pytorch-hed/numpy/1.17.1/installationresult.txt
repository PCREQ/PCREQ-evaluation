ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/pytorch-hed-numpy-1.17.1.txt (line 2) and numpy==1.17.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.17.1
    moviepy 2.0.0.dev2 depends on numpy>=1.17.3

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
