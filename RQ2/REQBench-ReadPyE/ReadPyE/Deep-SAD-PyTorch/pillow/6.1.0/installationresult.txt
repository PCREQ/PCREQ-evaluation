ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/Deep-SAD-PyTorch-pillow-6.1.0.txt (line 4) and pillow==6.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested pillow==6.1
    matplotlib 3.5.3 depends on pillow>=6.2.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
