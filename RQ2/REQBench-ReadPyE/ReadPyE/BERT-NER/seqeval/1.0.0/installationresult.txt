ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/BERT-NER-seqeval-1.0.0.txt (line 3) and numpy==1.21.6 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.21.6
    seqeval 1.0.0 depends on numpy==1.19.2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
