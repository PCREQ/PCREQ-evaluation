ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/RetinaFace_Pytorch-pillow-6.2.0.txt (line 13) and torch==1.5.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==1.5.1
    torchvision 0.12.0 depends on torch==1.11.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
