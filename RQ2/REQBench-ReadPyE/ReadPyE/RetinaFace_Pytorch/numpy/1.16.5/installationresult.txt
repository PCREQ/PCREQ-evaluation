ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/RetinaFace_Pytorch-numpy-1.16.5.txt (line 4), -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/RetinaFace_Pytorch-numpy-1.16.5.txt (line 5), -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/RetinaFace_Pytorch-numpy-1.16.5.txt (line 7) and numpy==1.16.5 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.16.5
    scipy 1.7.3 depends on numpy<1.23.0 and >=1.16.5
    opencv-python 4.6.0.66 depends on numpy>=1.14.5; python_version >= "3.7"
    matplotlib 3.5.3 depends on numpy>=1.17

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
