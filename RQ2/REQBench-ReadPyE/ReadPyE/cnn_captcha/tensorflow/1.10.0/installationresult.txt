ERROR: Cannot install -r /home/lei/compatibility_analysis/compare/ReadPyE/experiment/result/cnn_captcha-tensorflow-1.10.0-2.txt (line 4) and numpy==1.14.5 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.14.5
    matplotlib 3.3.4 depends on numpy>=1.15

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
