# PCREQ Evaluation

This repository contains the evaluation results of [PCREQ](https://github.com/PCREQ/PCREQ), assessing its capability to infer compatible requirements for TPL upgrades in Python projects.

## :open_file_folder: Directory Overview

- **`Motivating-Study/`**  
  Experimental results of our motivating study.  

- **`RQ1/`**  
  Evaluates PCREQ's performance on compatible requirements inference of TPL upgrades in Python projects.  
  - Uses the **REQBench** dataset.  

- **`RQ2/`**  
  Compares PCREQ against PyEGo and ReadPyE on compatible requirements inference of TPL upgrades in Python projects.  
  - Uses the **REQBench-PyEGo and REQBench-ReadPyE** datasets.  

- **`RQ3/`**  
  Compares PCREQ against DeepSeek (V3, R1) and ChatGPT (GPT-40) on compatible requirements inference of TPL upgrades in Python projects.    
  - Uses the **REQBench** dataset.  

- **`RQ4/`**  
  Measures PCREQ's runtime efficiency.  
  - Computes the inference time of test cases.
